<summary>Strong Opinions</summary>


Also known as Hard Truths.

#### Movies / TV / Books
- **Good** _Star Trek_ ended after _Enterprise_
- _Deep Space 9_ was peak _Star Trek_
- The Disney Star Wars trilogy wasn't **that** bad
- _Return of the Jedi_ was worse than _The Last Jedi_
- _Planet of Twilight_ was better than the _Young Jedi Knights_ series
- Post-Disney Star Wars Expanded Universe is even better than the Legends EU
- The B. Herbert/K.J. Anderson _Dune_ novels aren't that bad, just not as good as Frank Herbert's
- _Goonies_ is not great
- _The Mandalorian_ proved that shows like _Star Trek: Discovery_ could have captured the source material's vintage feel while still being excellent

#### Programming / Technology
- C89 was **perfect** except for implicit declaration
- JavaScript shouldn't be used except in the browser
- OOP shouldn't be attempted in C, or any language not designed with OOP in mind
- Cryptocurrency is a great technology but an unreliable investment
- Newer version of Windows have no place in a production environment
- Modern Linux is easier to install and use than modern Windows
- Quantum computing has definite practical applications, but will not replace traditional computing for simple calculations and logical operations
- Modern deep learning AI is not so far removed from simple curve-fitting algorithms and is no more capable of bias, racism, malice, or any other anthropomorphic quality than a spreadsheet
- We don't necessarily _need_ Linux, AI, or any other high-level technologies in most IoT devices, and adding them where they aren't needed is the source of most of IoT's security, privacy, and power consumption issues
- If it can't run DOOM then it isn't useful for day-to-day computing
- True privacy or trustless computing is ultimately impossible in the modern age, and there's nothing you can reasonably do about it except be aware of it
- Ender 3 remains one of the best choices for someone's first FDM 3D printer, in terms of capability and out-of-box experience

#### Politics / Philosophy
- Ulfric Stormcloak was wrong
- The USA not using metric is Benjamin Franklin's fault
- The USA saying "soccer" instead of "football" is Britain's fault
- All the common arguments for Simulation Theory are trite and if applied consistantly could argue for or against any possibility

#### Food
- Taco Bell and Little Ceasar's aren't bad for the price
- Sriracha is excellent on tex-mex dishes
- American cheese isn't Kraft Singles, the USA has a complex and proud heritage of quality cheeses
- Orange cheese in America is Britain's fault
- Tapenade is better than caviar in all situations
- Supermarket "greek yogurt" is just decent yogurt, and real Greek yogurt should be the consistency of neufchatel
- Discount day-old baked goods are the only logical choice unless you want something specialty or plan to eat the whole thing in a single day
